### HowTo

Start the simple python server on your computer:

    python2 ssl-server.py 0.0.0.0:4443
    
It will serve static pages from `html/` directory.

Now look up the IP address of your computer (e.g. via `ifconfig` or `ip a`) let's assume it is `192.168.2.3`.

Then open the following address ON YOUR PHONE (use Chrome): https://192.168.2.3/basic.html
